  <h1>What is a Deadlock?</h1>
  <div class="definition">
    <p>A deadlock is a situation in which two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource or take some action.</p>
    <p>In other words, a deadlock occurs when multiple processes are waiting for each other to complete, causing a cyclic dependency that cannot be resolved.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Conditions for a Deadlock</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mutual Exclusion</strong>: Two or more processes must be competing for a common resource that can only be accessed by one process at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Hold and Wait</strong>: One process must be holding a resource and waiting for another resource, which is held by another process.</li>
    <li><strong>No Preemption</strong>: The operating system must not be able to preempt one process and give the resource to another process.</li>
    <li><strong>Circular Wait</strong>: The processes must be waiting for each other to release a resource, forming a circular chain of dependencies.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Example of a Deadlock</h2>
  <div class="example">
    <p>Consider two processes, P1 and P2, that need to access two resources, R1 and R2. The sequence of events is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>P1 requests and receives R1.</li>
      <li>P2 requests and receives R2.</li>
      <li>P1 requests R2, but it is held by P2, so P1 waits.</li>
      <li>P2 requests R1, but it is held by P1, so P2 waits.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At this point, both P1 and P2 are waiting for each other to release a resource, causing a deadlock.</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Avoiding Deadlocks</h2>
  <p>To avoid deadlocks, system designers can use various techniques, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using mutexes and semaphores to synchronize access to shared resources.</li>
    <li>Implementing resource ordering to prevent circular waits.</li>
    <li>Using deadlock detection and recovery algorithms to identify and resolve deadlocks.</li>
  </ul>
